    "Angeline Aguinaldo is a Computer Science PhD Candidate at the University of Maryland, College Park, a software engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, and, previously, a research assistant at the Topos Institute. She received her Bachelor of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering and Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Drexel University. Her research is at the intersection of knowledge representation, robotic task planning, and category theory.\n",

    "Paul Dancstep is a right handed person who likes to do the dishes every other day. He has an initial mood of around 3 and a calmdown rate of probably 5% or so. He enjoys trying to come up with visualizations and explanations for abstract concepts and is optimistic that tools from applied category theory will have a role to play in human flourishing in the 21st century.\n",

    "Brendan Fong oversees coordination and strategic planning at Topos. He holds a PhD in computer science from Oxford, and undertook postdoctoral studies in systems engineering and mathematics at UPenn and MIT. He is a founding executive editor of the open-access journal Compositionality, and co-authored the textbook An Invitation to Applied Category Theory. Brendan believes technologies of connection and integration are already transforming the world we live in, and is dedicated to ensuring that these transformations benefit society-at-large.\n",

    "Priyaa is a compassionate mathematician working as a post-doctoral researcher at the Topos. She holds a PhD in Computer Science from University of Calgary. She is interested in creating pathways to make math communication user-friendly and approachable â€“ from math in school to graduate research. She derives inspiration from the works of Tai Danae Bradley, Eugenia Cheng, John Baez, Pawel Sobocinski, Bob Coecke, David Spivak and many others in this area. Her research experience spans quantum computing and category theory.  \n",
