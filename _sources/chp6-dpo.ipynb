    "The \"Find-and-replace\" feature of text editors is one of the most powerful innovations of the 20th century. Inspite of the unavailability of statistics, the advantage of this feature is tangible and undeniable! Beyond text editors, the concept of \"find and replace\" has also caused much chaos in the world! When the European conquerors \"found\" native Americans settlements in Canada, they decided to \"replace\" the native culture by sending an entire generation of native American children to special missionary schools. This has resulted in trauma and chaos that continues well into the current times. Or a country waging war over another country to replace the exisiting government for political reasons! Or the large-scale replacement of forests by industries and settlements has adversely impacting global climate. We know in hindsight this approach has lead humanity to face issues bigger than they the ones it intended to solve! \n",

    "> So, what was missed in the decision making process? \n",

    "Let us consider a fun and non-political example -- the struggle of qutting sugar. Here is a simple explanation of a why quitting sugar is so hard! A usual thought-process behind attempting to quit sugar is: \n",

    "(Naively) Being healthy and eating sugar makes a person happy in a different ways. Hence, removing sugar results in a broken connection and an unstable structure! The result is usually to restore stability by brining (more) sugar back! Even though this example is oversimplistic, it drives home the message connections playing an important role in driving our lives and why careful considerations of connections is necessary to make a positive change. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to make a change, it is recommended to start with something simple. The simple thing we shall do in this chapter is to build a way to make changes to an existing graph in a \"good\" way. By good, we mean that we do not end up with broken connections, and make precisely the changes that are intended. \n",
    "\n",
    "Making changes to a graph means adding new vertices/edges or removing existing vertices/edges or both. And these changes happen over particular region(s) of the graph (like a textual find and replace).\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of concepts in the world around us are modelled as graphs. Hence, building a way to changing an existing graph that is guaranteed to be good is much more than just a theoretical exercise.\n",

    "Let us begin! \n",

    "Given a pattern (a graph), and its replacement, our mission is to \"find\" the pattern in any host graph and \"replace\" it in a good way! \n",

    "## 7.2 Specs for \"find and replace\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say, we have a document in which we would like to replace some text by some other text. The Microsoft Word software provides an interface such as the one shown in the picture below for performing such \"find-and-replace\".  \n",

    "Let us say, we have a graph. How would the interface for find-and-replace in graphs look like? \n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, let us think what would be filled in the \"Find what:\" and \"Replace with:\" boxes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ```Find what``` box will take in a graph. This is the search pattern that will be matched in a host graph. The ```Replace with``` box will also take in a graph. This is the pattern that will replace the match found. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",

    "So what are we missing? In text documents, there is only one way of replacing a text by another once a match has been found. But in graphs, there are multiple ways of replacing one graph by another unless we say how the `Find` and the `Replace` relate.  \n",

    "During the replacement procedure, the vertices and edges of `Find` which do not overlap with `Replace` are removed from the match. For example, in the picture above, the self-loop of the search pattern is outside the overlap region. So, it is removed from the host graph at the match during the replacement procedure. Only those vertices and edges in the search pattern which overlap with the replacement are alone retained. From this view point, the morphism from `overlap` to `Find` is a **rule for deletion** (of vertices and edges at a match). \n",
    "\n",
    "During the replacement procedure, the vertices and the edges of (`Replace`) outside the overlap region are added to the host graph at the match. For example, in the picture above, the unlabelled vertices and edges of `Replace` are outside the overlap region. We could see that they are added to the host graph during the replacement. From this view point, the morphism from `overlap` to `Replace` is a **rule for addition** (of vertices and edges at a match).\n",

    "## 7.8 Relational thinking is hard but good!\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations for making it this far! Relational thinking might feel hard but it also brings so much value to our thinking and how we interact with the world around us! Here is our two cents on why we think so!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational thinking shifts vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "We would first like to bring reader's attention to the some vocabulary common in practice since language influences thinking and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of \"Find and replace\" is a crude one in the sense that it is unaware of the context of replacement. A text editor will allow me to replace \"truth\" by \"lie\" anywhere in a document. Context-unaware find and replace leads to chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematics we used to \"find-and-replace\" in graphs tells us that it is not a replacement, rather it is a careful integration of a new pattern in the place of an exisiting pattern. *To integrate* is organic and harmonoius by nature! While *to replace* has an air of superiority about it! Replace is useful -- replacing inflated tyres, replacing broken chain, etc.! However, in situations involving multiple interconnected entities, relational thinking recommends a shift in vocabulary from \"Find-and-replace\" to \"Find-and-integrate\" ot become a whole! \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Slogan\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "\n",
    " Replace \"replace\" by \"integrate\" \n",
    "\n",
    "::: \n",
    "\n",
    "This slogan probably is the answer to all the political issues which have been brought up at the beginning of this chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The order of processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take a moment reflect on the process of modifying a graph guided by relational thinking! \n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in this chapter, we modify by searching for a pattern in a graph. Once a match is found, we first remove and then add vertices and edges as indicated by the pattern to be integrated. Loosely speaking, in a free world, nothing prevents one from switching the order of these operations -- first add new vertices and edges and then remove, even though remove-first and add-next is more economic. An add-first and remove-next procedure must handle accidental errors which are otherwise absent in the other order: \n",
    "- Removing what has been added\n",
    "- Adding over the removal region. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, to remove first and to add next is elegant and as well as cleaner!  \n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in double pushouts, relational thinking precisely follows this order without any manual intervention! Somehow, the mathematics 'knew' that it must first remove by computing pushout complement and then add by computing pushout over that complement! Switching the order is not possible. It is a wonder how did the math get the ordering right?! Even though it is a mystery, there is a message that is being conveyed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Slogan\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "\n",
    " Think relationally to get it right rightaway!!\n",
    "\n",
    "::: \n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.9 Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "For modifying graphs, we first compute pushout complement followed by a pushout! All the edge cases that may otherwise occur when removing edges and vertices are automatically handled due to the universal nature of pushout! And finally, \n",
