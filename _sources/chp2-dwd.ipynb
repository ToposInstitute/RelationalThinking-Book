    "\n",
    "Let's start with a light bulb (what could be simpler?!). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Single light bulb\n",
    "\n",
    "We can *model* a light bulb using a directed graph with a single vertex and no edge. The light bulb is the vertex. \n",

    "This may seem simple -- almost trivially simple. What is the point of a graph if it doesn't even have any edges? Remember, however, that we are only modelling a single light bulb. Bear with us to see how we add states and an update rule to the case of a graph with one vertex. We'll then move on and see how it extends to situations like a traffic light, where there are multiple lights and hence many vertices and edges in our graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "A light bulb is always in one of two \"states\" -- either `OFF` or `ON`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} assets/Ch2/light-bulb-state.png\n",

    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We then add extra data to this vertex called *state* which gives on `ON`/`OFF` condition of the light bulb. At any instant of time, the state value is either `ON` or `OFF`. \n",

    " \n",
    "The above graph can be interpreted as a snapshot of the bulb at an instant in time! The graph has some dynamic nature to it in the sense that the state can be either `ON` or `OFF`. However, once set to `ON` or `OFF`, the vertex (light bulb) just stays at whatever state we set it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Adding state information to the vertices makes a graph slightly dynamic. A directed graph where each vertex has a state is a snapshot of an event in time.\n",

    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accomplish this, the light bulb has to toggle its states continuously. That is, if the present state is `ON`, it must switch `OFF`. If the present state is `OFF`, it must switch `ON`. It must perform this operation at every time step. What we described just now is called an  **update rule** -- a rule saying how a state is to be updated! \n",

    "> Update rules along along with the states enables a graph to model systems which evolve over time, a.k.a dynamical systems!\n",

    "- In the model of the string of lights, (at each time step) each vertex updated its state only based on the state received from its neighbor.\n",

    "- In the model of the traffic light, (at each time step) the controller updated its state only based on its current state. The light bulbs updated their states only based on the input received from the controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "The talking friends model will have slightly different features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this model, we will see that each vertex will update its state based on both its current state as well as the incoming state. \n",

    "Here's the story of Kiki and Bouba (recollected from introduction): \"Kiki and Bouba are great friends but are quite different characters! It is fun when they meet because Kiki is highly excitable and Bouba prefers to be on the grumpy side! However, they get along with each other quite well! Would it not be interesting to visualize how their mood levels change as they interact?!\"\n",

    "\n",
    "The purpose of this chapter is having fun with graphs by bringing them to life! Using directed graphs, we modeled systems which evolve over time! These systems are known as dynamical systems. We exported our models of dynamical systems to a computer as programs in Algebraic Julia. Using these programs, we visualized the evolution of these systems using plots and animations!\n",
    "\n",
    "We modeled two broad class of systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discrete systems:** All the systems in Section 2.3 (Light bulbs) fall under this category! Every light bulb and traffic controller has binary states - the value is either `ON` or `OFF`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Continuous systems:** All the systems in Section 2.4 (Kiki and Bouba) fall under this category! The state can vary continuously between -5 and +5. There are infinite number of values between -5 and +5.\n",
    "\n",
    "When modelling dynamical systems, we treated underlying graphs are blue prints. These graphs are special in the sense, they come with two pieces of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One or more states for each vertex\n",
    "2. An update rule for each state\n",
    "\n",
    "The arrows in the graph acts as a conduit carrying state information from one vertex to another. Each vertex is a (little) system within the larger system. \n",
    "\n",
    "For readers who are interested to explore further about using AlgebraicJulia to model dynamical systems and viewing more sophisticated examples, we recommend the documentation for [AlgebraicDynamics](https://algebraicjulia.github.io/AlgebraicDynamics.jl/dev/) package of AlgebraicJulia! \n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamical systems and directed graphs are a useful framework for modeling the world around us. Indeed, they are a close match for how humans tend to conceptualize things -- in terms of **cause and effect**, in terms of events which play out over time, and in terms of systems influencing one another! \n",
    "\n",
    "Cause and effect is just one way of looking at the world. And not all systems are best understood in this sense. There are systems that maintain **a kind of equilibrium** by satisfying simultaneous constraints. In the coming chapters we will develop this *relational* view, a subtle and versatile way of working with graphs having an emphasis on constraints and filters instead of step-by-step procedures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: In fact, in AlgebraicJulia we use an extended, richer abstraction called a `directed wiring diagram' which generalizes directed graphs. Directed wiring diagrams have richer capabilities, including nested modelling. Interested readers are referred to  \"Rupel, Dylan, and David I. Spivak. \"The operad of temporal wiring diagrams: formalizing a graphical language for discrete-time processes.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1307.6894 (2013).\""
