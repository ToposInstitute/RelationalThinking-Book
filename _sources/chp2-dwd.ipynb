However, they get along with each other quite well! Would it not be interesting to visualize how their mood levels change as they interact?! That is what this chapter is about -- visualizing Kiki and Bouba mood levels when they interact using the tools we built in the last chapter!\n",

    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We then add extra data to this vertex called *state* which gives on `ON`/`OFF` condition of the light bulb. At any instant of time, the state value is either `ON` or `OFF`. \n",

    "\n",
    "The purpose of this chapter is having fun with graphs by bringing them to life! Using \"directed graphs\" [^1] we modeled systems which evolve over time! These systems are known as dynamical systems. We exported our models of dynamical systems to a computer as programs in Algebraic Julia. Using these programs, we visualized the evolution of these systems using plots and animations!\n",
    "\n",
    "We modeled two broad class of systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discrete systems:** All the systems in Section 2.3 (Light bulbs) fall under this category! Every light bulb and traffic controller has binary states - the value is either `ON` or `OFF`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Continous systems:** All the systems in Section 2.4 (Kiki and Bouba) fall under this category! The state can vary continously between -5 and +5. There are infinite number of values between -5 and +5.\n",
    "\n",
    "When modelling dynamical systems, we treated underlying graphs are blue prints. These graphs are special in the sense, they come with two pieces of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One or more states for each vertex\n",
    "2. An update rule for each state\n",
    "\n",
    "The arrows in the graph acts as a conduit carrying state information from one vertex to another. Each vertex is a (little) system within the larger system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For readers who are interested to explore further about using AlgebraicJulia to model dynamical systems and viewing more sohpisticated examples, we recommend the documentation for [AlgebraicDynamics](https://algebraicjulia.github.io/AlgebraicDynamics.jl/dev/) package of AlgebraicJulia! \n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamical systems and directed graphs are a useful framework for modeling the world around us. Indeed, they are a close match for how humans tend to conceptualize things -- in terms of cause and effect, in terms of events which play out over time, and in terms of systems influencing one another! \n",
    "\n",
    "But this is just one way of looking at the world. And not all systems are best understood in this sense. These are systems that maintain a kind of equilibrium or balancing act between simultaneous constraints. In the coming chapters we will develop to a more *relational* view, a subtle and versatile way of working with graphs having an emphasis on constraints and filters instead of step-by-step procedures."
