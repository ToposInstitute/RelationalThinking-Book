    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have seen that graphs are a simple and powerful tool to model relationships between various entities. We also learnt the idea of identifying one graph inside another via a graph morphism. A graph morphism may coarse-grain the information in the domain graph by sending two different vertices/edges of the domain (the graph from which the morphism proceeds) to the same vertex/edge in the codomain (the graph in which the morphism lands) but it always **preserves the connectivity** of the domain. Finally, excitingly, with graph morphisms, we enter the \"universe\" where we can find every possible \"graph-world\" and every possible relationships between these worlds. We introduced the relational thinking term \"category\" to refer to a universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we \"live\" inside the category where the only entities are undirected graphs and morphisms between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside this category, we are interested to know how to **combine two graphs into one** which is analogous to adding two numbers (if this analogy sounds odd to you, towards the end of this chapter we will see that adding numbers is same as combining two *discrete* graphs). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking of a graph as an island of connections, the utility of combining graphs is to bridge these islands allowing for information to flow between the graphs (via common channels) and for the expression of new meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a step towards making sense of the idea of combining graphs, let us a revisit a graph that we met in the first chapter — “Whose turn is it to do dishes?”.\n",

    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this graph, Paul claimed to be friends with Tuco (to our unaware readers, Tuco is Paul’s neighbor’s cat). Paul is also a friend of Brendan, Angeline and Priyaa (co-authors of this book). Encoding these friendships as graphs, we get:\n",

    "\n",
    "Read each one of the edge in the above graphs as “is a friend of”. Combining the above two friendship graphs along the common vertex Paul into a single friendship graph, we get:\n",

    ":width: 460px\n",

    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We see new information emerging in the combined graph. Tuco “is a friend of a friend” for Brendan, Priyaa, and Angeline. If we assume that a friend of a friend is a friend, then one can infer that Tuco “is a friend of” Brendan, Angeline and Priyaa. After all, who does not want to be friends with Tuco?! The connections in the combined graph supports such assumptions and inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example is deceivingly simple. By eyeballing the two friendship graphs, it is easy to see by common experience how the graphs can be combined. But, graphs generated in the real world[^1] are quite complex. \n",

    "In practice, combining such graphs using pen and paper is out question! However, it is the same common sense that is in play combining even the most complex graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this chapter is to get our inherent common sense of combining graphs in a computation form while having fun! Once in a computational form, we all can agree unambiguously what does it *mean* to combine two graphs together. We will achieve this goal by playing a game of dumb charades of graphs using memes from relational thinking (popularly known as category theory)! \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge of this game is to communicate what a combined graph is without explicitly saying talking about its vertices and edges! This is because, while in the category we can talk (only) about relationships between graphs. Once we look inside a graph, we will no longer be in the category but we would be inside a graph-world and be unaware of any other (graph) worlds. A *combined* graph needs to be aware of the graphs which it combined (otherwise it just any old graph). So, we need to stay in the level of category (Rung 4) to talk about combining graphs!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 Combining graphs using memes\n",
    "\n",
    "The two memes we will use to play this game are: (1) commuting diagrams (closed loop conditions), and (2) graph morphisms. We explored in the previous chapter, the idea of commuting diagrams and graph morphisms (identifying one graph inside the other). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Game description\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first introduce some **terminology**: we call the graph we get by combining two graphs as the `pushout` of the two graphs.\n",

    "**Goal:** To describe the `pushout` of any two (overlapping) graphs!\n",

    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "A `pushout` (of two overlapping graphs) of two graphs is a graph in the category (universe) of all possible graphs. We need to spot that graph in this category! We will narrow down our search step-by-step using the memes we have learnt. We will continue this process until we end up with the graph we are looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will draw lots and lots of diagrams for this narrowing down process! Drawing diagrams are bread and butter of relational thinking!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The shape of the overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine two graphs, we first need to know what are the vertices and edges common to both the graphs. Recollect that the “Paul” vertex was common to both the friendship graphs we met early in the chapter. We call such common vertices and edges between two graphs to be their *overlap*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in previous chapters that a graph morphism identifies one graph inside the other. Suppose we are given two graphs -- `graph A` and `graph B`. An overlap of these two graphs is specified as the diagram below:\n",

    "```\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The above diagram has two radiating arrows, one into `graph A` and another one into `graph B`. Each arrow is a graph morphism. Graph `overlap` specifies the vertices and edges common to `graph A` and `graph B`! Note that a relational specification of common vertices and edges as shown below ensures that the overlapping region will be a graph by itself (no dangling edges)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationships between the graphs in the above diagram are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `overlap` maps into `graph A`.\n",
    "- `overlap` maps into `graph B`.\n",
    "- Thus, the regions in which `overlap` maps into `graph A` and `graph B` are common to the two graphs.\n",
    " \n",
    "(The graph morphisms in the above diagram are injective, but in general they need not be so! Connecitivity matters!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `overlap` acts as a bridge between two graphs. Theoretically, presence of an overlap means that we can navigate from one graph to the other via common vertices and edges. That is, we can combine `graph A` and `graph B` into a single graph. This idea of a combining graphs can be loosely illustrated as sticking together two sheets of paper using glue.\n",

    "Things get quite complex and rich quickly as we add relationships and ask the relationships to satisfy more and more constraints. However, setting things up right and relational makes life better because all the nuances are handled early-on in the thinking process. This eliminates the need to think cleverly about the edge cases later on when the complexity of the system increases.  We will demonstrate this idea in the next chapter when we look into the concept of “find and replace” inside graphs! You would be accustomed to using the “find-and-replace” operation in text editors. In the next chapter, we shall apply the idea of “find-and-replace” to graphs by computing pushouts. \n",
