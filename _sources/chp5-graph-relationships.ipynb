The above picture shows three instances for each schema.  While it isn't practical to specify _every_ possible instance of a graph schema, it is practical to imagine a _universe_ that has all possible instances floating in space, one endless swarm of things the schema refers to.

    "One way to think about the relationship between the winter and the summer graphs is that we can turn one into the other.

On the other hand, given the Winter map, I can create the Summer map by _deleting_ the arrows and vertices associated with the village.\n",

    "Note how the Summer graph is basically contained inside of the Winter graph. For the Summer graph to be a \"part\" of the Winter graph means, in effect, that we can map the vertices of the Summer graph¬†*into*¬†the vertices of the Winter graph, and the arrows of the summer graph *into* the the arrows of the winter arrows, as in the picture below.\n",

But, our geometric understanding has precise correlation with AlgebraicJulia's formal representation of graph morphisms using <mark> pairs of maps and closed loops </mark> (Rung 2 and 3). Thus, we each have our own \"language\" for describing graph morphisms.\n",

As we observed back in Chapter 0, thinking visually and geometrically about graphs is an _excellent_ way for humans to conceptualize structure. In fact, for the remainder of this book we will _only_ be thinking about graphs and graph morphisms in these natural geometric terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "AlgebraicJulia's view is more abstract but is useful to us because it can be readily worked with in computational terms. Recall puzzle 3 above, where we gave AlgebraicJulia the data of two graphs and asked it to count up all the morphisms between them. AlgebraicJulia correctly found three. Diagrammatically, we depict these morphisms as three distinct **arrows** going from one graph instance to the other.\n",

We now can say that _between_ those instances are **arrows** representing morphisms. Just as it was impractical to try to depict all of the instances of a graph schema, it is also impractical to try to depict all the instances of morphisms between two graphs. But in our imagination we can fill in enough of these arrows to appreciate the vast interconnected universe of relationships between graphs. This universe of thought bubbles and arrows is called a category, in this case the \"category of instances\" for a given schema.\n",

    "In this chapter we have developed the crucial idea of **graph morphisms**. We have understood this concept from two points of view, the geometric human view and the more formal computational vantage of AlgebraicJulia. The exact correspondence between these views means that if we _only_ think about graphs and graph morphisms geometrically then everything we think can be encoded in AlgebraicJulia!! In the next two chapters we will discover patterns of morphisms that correspond to useful operations like adding, deleting, merging, etc. And we shall see that when we operationalize these patterns with AlgebraicJulia, we end up in a very advantageous position with regards to the `DANGLING EDGE CONDITION`.\n",
