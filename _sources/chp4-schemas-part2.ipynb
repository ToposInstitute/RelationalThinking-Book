    "* Vertices are the states of the game\n",
    "* Arrows are \"moves\" of the game, going from one state to another.\n",

    "Now let's imagine doing the same thing for the ancient board game Go. An important thing to know about this game is that the player always has the option to \"pass.\" That is, one of the available moves on any given turn is to stay in the current state. Thus, every vertex in our graph is going to have one special arrow that loops back on itself.\n",

    "This actually happens a lot when modeling with directed graphs: we find ourselves wanting every vertex to have a special \"self-looping\" arrow attached to it. In fact, this happens so frequently that we give these graphs a special name - they're called \"reflexive graphs.\" They are widespread and useful. In applied settings they are excellent for geometric applications. Reflexive relationships are prevalent in mathematics (divisibility among the integers, subsets among sets, etc.). And in category theory all structures of interest (preorders, categories, etc.) are reflexive graphs.\n",

    "\n",
    ">Indeed, one of the profound offerings of AlgebraicJulia is the sheer number of mathematical abstractions it can handle in terms of schemas. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this final section we offer a brief glimpse at some more powerful models and ideas that are also captured by this framework.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Simplicial sets\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generalize reflexive graphs to higher dimensions using schemas. The result is one of the algebraic topologist's favorite tools: simplicial sets. Ordinary graphs connect 0-dimensional vertices using 1-dimensional lines. With simplicial sets we can also attach 2-dimensional triangles, building up triangulated surfaces. Going up another dimension we can attach 3-dimensional tetrahedra to make solid figures. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the mathematician, simplicial sets are useful because they turn geometry into algebra: a simplicial triangulation of a topological space is a combinatorial object that can be reasoned about. For the applied scientist, simplicial sets may be useful as a way of 3D modeling, as we'll see in Chapter 8. Finally, in AlgebraicJulia, simplicial sets are practical because all of the rules for how different parts must attach can be fully captured with a few commutativity conditions.\n",

    "### Petri nets\n",
    "\n",
    "On the more \"applied\" side, we have the example of Petri nets, a sophisticated modeling system for the analysis of concurrent systems. It was developed by German computer scientist Carl Adam Petri in the 1960's, whose goal was to provide a system that could model parallel processes, synchronization and resource sharing. Petri nets provide a modeling tool that is suitable for a wide variety of systems, from chemical reactions to business management logistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that Petri nets were developed by practitioners, not mathematicians. The system was born from necessity, designed to fill a utility gap in other approaches to modeling. But because Carl Petri gave the system an exact mathematical definition for its execution semantics we are able to represent Petri nets in terms of schemas and work with them in AlgebraicJulia.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole concept of a schema originally comes from database theory. We can think of the underlying connections in a schema as linked data. For example the grey circles may represent a database of 'people' and a given arrow may repesent a tabulated relationship between those people (Who loves whom? Who is the enemy of whom? etc.) Structuring a query on that database is then just building a schema to define new relationships in terms of existing ones.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data often gets corrupted when transferred between contexts, a major issue in database management. Data corruption is a kind of analog for our `DANGLING EDGE CONDITION` on graphs. And in the same way that AlgebraicJulia will allow us to use high level abstractions to resolve our dangling edge problems, there are other category theoretic techniques for data migration that offer a canonical way of migrating data that automatically takes care of various annoying edge conditions. See the paper Functorial Data Migration[^2] for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.5 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we have developed the concept of a schema, a versatile data structure and the principal way to define things in AlgebraicJulia. In the next chapter we will put this idea to a specific use, characterizing a certain kind of graph relationship as a schema. In subsequent chapters that relationship will give us a way to manipulate graphs without having to worry about the `DANGLING EDGE CONDITION`.\n",
