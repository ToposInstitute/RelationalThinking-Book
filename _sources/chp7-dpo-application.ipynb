    "## 8.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have uncovered many powerful concepts for modeling graphs and making changes to them. Using **schema**, We neatly packaged up data of a graph in a way that we can recover all its fundamental concepts -- vertices and edges, and how they relate to one another. Using **double-pushouts (DPO)**, we can edit an exisiting graph. With the capability to edit graphs, we can now model a number of graph-based scenarios such as, chemical reactions, and game design. \n",
    "\n",
    "Schemas provide us with a language to talk about the concepts we wish to shed light on. The graph schema highlights edges and how they relate to nodes. Being remarkably general, schemas encourage us to be more ambitious and ask how can they model something non-graph based and more complex? For example, what if we were interested in talking about parts of a car or items in your kitchen? What parts go inside the other? What is wet and what is dry? And what items go with what and what items don't go together? We would have to do quite a bit of mental book-keeping to talk in the language of graphs--\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"For example, a bottle of Coca-Cola soda is a vertex and my refridgerator is another vertex... an edge between them means that the Coca-Cola soda _is in_ the refridgerator,... but an edge between the soda and the vertex for a box of Mentos may mean that that the Mentos should _never be put in_ the soda... edges take different meaning for each connection\"\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "If you put Mentos in a soda, it will explode.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "So, graphs might not be a great idea to model my kitchen. Lucky for us, what we have learned so far have applications beyond graphs. The rest of this chapter is a simple demonstration of the use of schemas to modelling some complex scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.2 Cube Configuration\n",
    "Let's start by simply extending the graph schema with another concept, like **faces**. Let us we want to model a cube. A face in a cube has four edges. So, along with `Edge` and `Vertex` and their relationship, the schema for a cube also consists of `Face`, and its relationship to `edge`(s). This schema has six relationships: \n",

    "We can model various configurations of a cube, akin to unfolding a cardboard box. For instance, using DPO rewriting, we could model the action of opening or closing the top of the box. This operation would involve redefining the relationships between the Faces and Edges objects to \"remove\" the connections that form the top face. Similarly, unfolding the cube into a flat layout would radically alter the connections between Faces, Edges, and Vertices to represent the cube in an unfolded state. Such transformations are powerful for visualizing and reasoning about the structural possibilities of boxes in three-dimensional space.\n",

    "Let us say we want to have a cube representing a box with a birthday cake in it. When we deliver the cake to a friend, it starts off as closed. We can say that it's closed by explaining how the faces, edges, and vertices are related to one another. In a cube, there are exactly six faces, which we can call `f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6`. Each face has exactly four edges, which we call the top, bottom, left, and right edges. Edges can also have names, such as `e1, e2, e3, e4, ...`. If we want to say the top of edge of `f1` is `e1`, then we can refer to the schema and express the the following piece of data:\n",

    "Relative to our other examples, this schema has substantially more object and morphisms which would require a burdensome amount of syntax to define a find-and-replace rule, also called as, `ACSetTransformation` for `find` and `replace`. Instead, we can compute its _colimit of representables_ [^1]. Computing the _colimit of representables_ allows us to fill in the rest of the schema's instances when only part of it has been specified. With this, the homomorphism maps, `l` and `r`, between rule parts can be inferred based on the rest of the schemas' instances. This functionality is subsumed in `make_rule()`.\n",

Choosing to model the cheese being on bread as the fusion of cheese and bread is a knowledge engineering choice. This can easily have been represented using a relation about the cheese being on top of the bread. This further demonstrates the flexibility of DPO-rewriting rules.\n",

In the case of the bread slice, the function that does this mapping is tied to the `food_is_on` morphism and, in the case of plate, the function that maps it to entity is tied to the `ware_is_entity` morphism. This is effectively saying that the entity that the food is on is the same entity as the plate. \n",

    "As we have seen, double-pushout rewriting can be used to update information that we know about the world both explicitly and implicitly. Explicitly, this is done by defining the rewrite rules and what we would like to change. Implicit information is captured by filling out the rest of the schema's instances based on the explicit information. In robotics and AI planning, this accounting of both implicit and explicit effects on the world is called the _frame problem_ and is a feature that must be carefully considered when designing planning languages for such purposes. This provides an elegant mathematical solution to this age-old problem. \n",

    "## 8.4 Summary\n",
    "Both examples illustrate the versatility of schemas and double-pushout rewriting in modeling transformations across different contexts. From the reconfiguration of physical structures like cubes to the dynamic arrangement of items in a kitchen, DPO rewriting provides a powerful tool for modeling and simulating changes in languages other than graphs. In particular, these concepts have shown promise in managing world states when doing task planning in robotics.[^2] For the ambitious reader, we encourage you to not end your study here, but refer to advanced expositions of these topics.[^3][^4][^5]\n",
